# Weather Info
# Project Technologies:
- Dart language
- Flutter framework with MVC and Provider architecture
# Project Functionalities:
- API Calling: The app utilizes API calls to fetch weather data from reliable weather data
  providers. This ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date weather information for their
  desired locations.
- Shared Preferences: "Sky Scrapper" incorporates Shared Preferences to enhance the user
  experience. Users can save specific cities or states of interest, and this information is stored
  locally. The app provides a dedicated page where users can view their saved locations for quick
  access to weather details.
- Network Connectivity: The app includes network connectivity checks to ensure uninterrupted
  access to weather data. In scenarios where network connectivity is unavailable, the app
  gracefully handles errors and presents an error screen, notifying the user about the network
  unavailability and suggesting alternative actions.
- Fetch City/State/Country Wise Weather Detail: Users can search for weather details by
  entering the name of a city, state, or country. The app retrieves the relevant weather information
  and displays it in an organized and user-friendly manner, including temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, and other relevant meteorological data.

  themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring
  comfortable usage in different lighting conditions and personalizing their weather app
  experience.
